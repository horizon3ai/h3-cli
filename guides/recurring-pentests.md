## h3-cli: Automated scheduling using h3-cli

A common use case for h3-cli is running pentests automatically on a recurring basis, for example once a week or once a month,
without any required user intervention - no need to log into the Portal, no need to copy+paste NodeZero launch scripts. 

The instructions below walk through how to use h3-cli to configure a pentest to run automatically on a regular basis.

‚ùó **Note:** You can also create pentest schedules directly in the Portal. See [here](https://docs.horizon3.ai/reference/scheduling/) for more info.



## 1. Enable automated NodeZero deployment 

If you plan to run _internal_ pentests (which are the default), you will need 
to enable h3-cli to automatically deploy NodeZero on a Docker Host inside your
network.

This is done using a [NodeZero Runner](touchless-nodezero.md).  The NodeZero Runner is 
a background process running on your Docker Host that automatically launches NodeZero
whenever a new pentest is assigned to it.

To set up a NodeZero Runner, follow the instructions [here](touchless-nodezero.md).


## 2. Create a scheduled action to run a pentest on a recurring schedule

The command below will create a recurring schedule called `my-schedule` that will automatically run 
a pentest every Monday at 5pm UTC.  

```shell
h3 create-scheduled-action \
    my-schedule \
    '0 17 * * 1' \
    run-pentest '{"schedule_op_form":{"op_name":"Pentest created via h3-cli and launched via runner", "runner_name":"my-nodezero-runner"}}' 
```

The command uses a [CRON expression](https://crontab.guru/), `0 17 * * 1`, to specify the recurring 
schedule for the pentest.

Breaking it down:

* `my-schedule` is the name of the schedule.  A schedule may contain multiple actions.  For example,
you can configure timing windows for pentesting around by business hours, by scheduling a pentest to 
launch on Monday at 5pm, pause every day at 8am, resume at 5pm, and finally terminate on Friday if it is still running.
* `0 17 * * 1` is the [CRON expression](https://crontab.guru/).  CRON expressions specify the 
`{minute} {hour} {day-of-month} {month} {day-of-week}` to run a given action.  Visit the [link]((https://crontab.guru/) 
for more information about CRON expressions.
    * **NOTE:** Only hourly resolution is supported.  The `{minute}` component of the CRON expression is always forced to be `0` on the backend.
    * CRON expressions are in **UTC** time.  So the example CRON expression above is set to **5pm UTC**.
* `run-pentest` is the action.  Supported actions are:
    * `run-pentest`: launches a new pentest (if one is not currently active for this schedule)
    * `pause-pentest`: pauses the active pentest associated with the schedule
    * `resume-pentest`: resumes the active pentest associated with the schedule
    * `cancel-pentest`: cancel the active pentest associated with the schedule
* `'{"schedule_op_form":{"op_name":"Pentest created via h3-cli and launched via runner", "runner_name":"my-nodezero-runner"}}'`: additional parameters for the `run-pentest` action.  These parameters are
the same as those you would use if you executed `h3 run-pentest` directly from the command line.

A named schedule can have **only one active pentest at a time**.  This prevents a schedule from kicking off 
a new pentest when its previous pentest has not yet completed.


### Troubleshooting: `[403] You are not authorized`

If you receive the error `[403] You are not authorized`, you may be trying to use your **Nodezero Runner** API key to create the pentest schedule.
For security reasons, Nodezero Runners have restricted permissions.  All they can do (more or less) is run NodeZero
for an already created pentest.  They cannot create new pentests, view pentest results, or create pentest schedules.

To create a pentest schedule, you'll need to create a separate API key with **User** permissions.  You can then create a separate h3-cli
profile for the new API key, and easily switch between multiple h3-cli profiles as needed.  

Learn more about managing h3-cli profiles [here](https://docs.horizon3.ai/reference/api/cli/readme/#h3-cli-profiles).

## 3. Verify your schedule is registered with H3

Use the following command to view your pentest schedules:

```shell
h3 schedules
```

If all is well, you should see an entry for your schedule `my-schedule`.


## 4. Test your scheduled action by triggering it now

To ensure everything is wired up as expected, you can trigger your scheduled action immediately
with the following command:

```shell
h3 trigger-scheduled-action my-schedule run-pentest 
```

This will trigger the `run-pentest` action for the `my-schedule` schedule, which will cause a 
pentest to be created.  The NodeZero Runner on your NodeZero Docker Host will see the new pentest 
and automatically launch NodeZero.

You can monitor the NodeZero Runner process by tailing the log:

```shell
tail -f /tmp/my-nodezero-runner.log
```

In a minute or so you should see the Runner kick off the NodeZero Launch Script for the newly 
created pentest.  The NodeZero Launch Script will download and launch the NodeZero Docker container
on the local machine, just as if you had copy+pasted the `curl` command from Run Pentest wizard in the Portal.

You can view the newly created pentest via:

```shell
h3 pentest 
```

Side note: If for whatever reason you need to kill the NodeZero Launch Script before it downloads and launches NodeZero,
you can use `pkill`:

```shell
pkill -f h3-run-nodezero
```

Once the NodeZero Docker container is running, you can manage its lifecycle via the Docker API.

## 5. Troubleshooting

If you don't see NodeZero get launched in the NodeZero Runner log, use `h3 schedules` to see if
any errors occurred when the action was triggered:

```shell
h3 schedules
```

The command output will resemble the readout below.  Look at the `last_triggered_*` fields to help diagnose
any problems:

```shell
{
  "name": "my-schedule",
  "state": "ENABLED",
  "created_at": "2023-02-06T06:52:04.660895",
  "last_updated_at": "2023-02-10T23:16:36.722392",
  "actions": [
    {
      "action": "run-pentest",
      "params": {
        "schedule_op_form": {
            "op_name": "Pentest created via h3-cli and launched via runner", 
            "runner_name": "my-nodezero-runner"
        }
      },
      "cron_expression": "0 17 * * 1",
      "cron_description": "At 05:00 PM, only on Monday",
      "last_triggered_at": "2023-02-10T22:08:05.010069",
      "last_triggered_time_ago": "an hour ago",
      "last_triggered_error": null
    }
  ]
}
```

You will also receive an email notification every time a scheduled action is triggered.  If the action fails,
the error will be included in the email.

For further assistance, contact H3 support via the chat icon in the [Portal](https://portal.horizon3ai.com/).


## 6. Create a second scheduled action to cancel the pentest (optional)

Let's add a second action to our schedule for canceling the pentest.  We'll schedule it to run 1hr after the pentest 
is launched.

```shell
h3 create-scheduled-action my-schedule '0 18 * * 1' cancel-pentest
```

Once again we can test the action by triggering it immediately:

```shell
h3 trigger-scheduled-action my-schedule cancel-pentest 
```

After a moment you should see your pentest get canceled and move into the post-processing state.


## 7. Enabling and disabling a schedule

You can view all of your schedules via:

```shell
h3 schedules
```

You can disable a schedule and all its actions via `disable-schedule`:

```shell
h3 disable-schedule my-schedule
```

And you can re-enable a schedule via `enable-schedule`:

```shell
h3 enable-schedule my-schedule
```


## 8. Configuring pentesting windows

You can use scheduled actions to pause and resume pentests around pentesting windows, e.g. around business hours.
The commands below show how to create a schedule that will:

* launch pentests on Mondays at 5pm UTC
* pause the running pentest every weekday at 8am UTC 
* resume the paused pentest every weekday at 5pm UTC
* cancel the pentest if it's still running on Friday at 8am UTC 

```shell
h3 create-scheduled-action my-schedule '0 17 * * 1' run-pentest '{"schedule_op_form":{"op_name":"Auto-scheduled weekly pentest", "runner_name":"my-nodezero-runner"}}' 
h3 create-scheduled-action my-schedule '0 8 * * 2-4' pause-pentest 
h3 create-scheduled-action my-schedule '0 17 * * 2-4' resume-pentest 
h3 create-scheduled-action my-schedule '0 8 * * 5' cancel-pentest 
```


## 9. Updating and deleting scheduled actions

You can update a scheduled action by simply running the `create-scheduled-action` again with the new settings.
For example, if you wish to change the schedule above such that it cancels the pentest at 7am UTC instead of 8am:

```shell
h3 create-scheduled-action my-schedule '0 7 * * 5' cancel-pentest 
```

Or if you wish to delete a scheduled action, use the `delete-scheduled-action` command:

```shell
h3 delete-scheduled-action my-schedule cancel-pentest
```

## 10. Creating multiple schedules

You can create multiple schedules by simply using a different schedule name.  For example, here's
a separate schedule named `my-weekend-schedule` that launches a pentest on Friday at 5pm UTC and cancels it Monday at 8am UTC:

```shell
h3 create-scheduled-action my-weekend-schedule '0 17 * * 5' run-pentest '{"schedule_op_form":{"op_name":"Weekend Pentest", "runner_name":"my-nodezero-runner"}}' 
h3 create-scheduled-action my-weekend-schedule '0 8 * * 1' cancel-pentest 
```
